# SimpleCoreLib
The 1.16+ sequel to SimpleCore, which consists of common api code pulled from Simple Ores.

My semantic versioning has changed as of 1.17: 
    * MAJOR version changes with Minecraft version changes that require major code rewrites.  
    * MINOR version changes: breaking changes within a Minecraft version.
    * PATCH level version: we changed something.
    * BUILDNumber: should now be irrelevant. Mostly.
